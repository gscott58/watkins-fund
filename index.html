                    <li>It was <strong>God’s</strong> perfect timing that our paths crossed this past Wednesday <strong>August 15th</strong>, on your aunt’s birthday.  Your aunt and me were over-whelmed and touched by the moment.  As the below six second video illustrates, you were touched too!.  We looked up and there you were, getting off a CTA bus.  <strong>God</strong> sent you with the financial blessing we so desperately needed (thank you again).</li>

                    <li>Consider this phone number <strong>(773-469-4013)</strong> as your aunt's and my official contact phone number (text and voice).  Feel free to distribute this number to any and all family members who wish to communicate with us.  As I'm sure everyone is aware, your aunt and me are on a bumpy road to financial recovery; so financial contributions from family would be helpful and greatly appreciated.</li>

                    <br>
                    <li>Family members wishing to contribute and who <u>do</u> <u>not</u> bank with Chase bank can drop by any JP Morgan Chase bank branch and deposit their contribution directly into our JP Morgan Chase Bank checking account <strong>(111-0011-891-318)</strong>.</li>
